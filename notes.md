#The Plan

So who's who and what we gonna do? As far as I (Andrew) know now, there are just two people involved with this project (although I'm pretty sure more might be added):
*Zach Burchill
*Andrew Burchill

However, we need to figure out exactly what needs to be done and who's going to do it.

##Things to do:

 * Filler
 * Be magic

##Notes, comments, other news

If you want to get TONS of webcomics incredibly rapidly (perhaps without the intelligent part of any of this), then check out [http://www.webtoons.com/en/](http://www.webtoons.com/en/). They're all on the same system, so it'll be darn easy to get data from them.
